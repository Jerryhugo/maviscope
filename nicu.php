                <h5>Advanced Care for Our Most Precious Patients</h5>
                <p>At Maviscope Hospital, our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is a world-class, high-tech facility dedicated to providing specialized, life-saving care for premature and critically ill newborns. We combine cutting-edge medical technology with a team of highly trained neonatologists, pediatricians, neonatal nurses, and respiratory therapists to give every baby the best possible start in life.
                <h5> <b>Expert Care for Preterm and High-Risk Newborns</b></h5>
                <p>Our NICU is designed to care for babies born prematurely, with low birth weight, or with medical conditions requiring specialized attention. We provide:</p>
                <div>
                    <p><span>Incubators & Thermoregulation: </span><br> Advanced incubators maintain a stable, warm environment, crucial for preterm babies who cannot regulate their own body temperature.</p>
                    <p><span>Ventilation & Respiratory Support: </span><br> Babies with breathing difficulties receive state-of-the-art Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), mechanical ventilators, and oxygen therapy to support their delicate lungs.</p>
                    <p><span>Parenteral & Enteral Nutrition:</span><br>  We ensure proper growth and development with IV nutrition (TPN) and gradual transition to specialized feeding protocols suited for fragile neonates.
                    </p>
                    <p><span>Neonatal Monitoring:</span><br> Real-time monitoring of heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure ensures early detection of any complications.</p>
                    

                    <p><span>Phototherapy for Jaundice: </span><br> High-intensity phototherapy lights help treat newborn jaundice effectively.</p>
                    <p><span>Infection Control & Sepsis Management:</span><br> Strict infection control measures and early intervention protocols prevent and manage neonatal infections, which are common in preterm babies.

                    </p>
                    <p><span>Neonatal Surgeries & Specialist Consults:</span><br> For babies needing surgical intervention or specialist care, we collaborate with top pediatric surgeons, cardiologists, neurologists, and other experts to provide comprehensive treatment.</p>

                    <p><span>Parental Education & Support: </span><br> Our team provides guidance, emotional support, and hands-on training for parents to help them care for their baby during and after discharge.</p>
                    <p><span>Gradual Transition to Home Care: </span><br> We ensure a smooth transition by equipping parents with the knowledge and skills needed to care for their baby outside the hospital.
